# R_benchmark_test

This software benchmark explores the performance of R analytics over a large data set on a TidalScale system.

The TidalScale HyperKernel provides the ability to scale-up the execution of applications beyond the limits of a single physical server. Unlike traditional scale-up or scale-out approaches — which either require purchasing new hardware or rewriting software to run across clusters — TidalScale’s approach creates a Software-Defined Server that runs on existing commodity hardware and doesn’t require any changes to operating systems or application software. The result: improving application performance and achieving insights sooner without the expense of scaling up or the time lost to traditional scale-out efforts. 

R is an analytic and statistical programming language whose use is rapidly spreading as organizations sharpen their ability to understand and learn from data they amass. Many operations in R are memory intensive, and analysts and data scientists often struggle to keep their working data sets within the limitations of a single computer to avoided the dreaded "Memory Cliff".

The TidalScale Hyperkernel makes it possible for multiple physical computers to operate as a single system which enables the unmodified application to use the aggregate RAM, CPUs and I/O of the underlying hardware. The R application therefore "sees" a single computer system while the TidalScale Hyperkernels enable growth and performance by scaling-out on commodity hardware. 

In this benchmark, we compare the performance and capacity of R applications with large datasets, running on "bare metal" servers versus a server instance on TidalScale. The benchmark results illustrate important aspects of TidalScale performance as of version 1.0. We demonstrate scalable performance of five different R operations which, more generally, are representative of the kinds of analytic workloads that benefit from running on large, coherent systems.

## Test Software

This software test requires the following software:

* CentOS 7.2
* Revolution R Open 8.0.3 with a CRAN snapshot taken on 2015-12-01

The runtests.sh script relies on a CentOS time utility that can be installed with the following command at the Linux shell:

$ sudo yum install time
$ sudo yum install htop
$ sudo yum install R

## Downloading the Test Data

All data is accessible from the Data Entrepreneurs Synthetic Public Use Data Set (see https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF.html).

Run the scripts/cms_data_download.sh script at the Linux command line to download all of the necessary data files in a directory that has >70GB storage space. Then you must modify runtests.sh execution line to point at that directory.

To run all of the different-sized R tests in one go, simply run the runtests.sh script at the Linux command line. A full test run takes about four days (if you have a system large enough to hold all the data in memory ;).

## Installing R & packages

To install R:

$ sudo yum install epel-release -y
$ sudo yum install R -y

After installing R you will need to install the following packages one at a time from inside R:

> install.packages('foo', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org') 

Where 'foo'= (checkpoint, pryr, dplyr, mgcv, rpart, randomForest, FNN, doParallel, foreach, Matrix)

## Running the Test

This is a long running job so it is convenient to start a tmux session and then execute the runtest.sh script from there. 

$ ./runtests.sh

You can edit the runtests.sh script to test any combination of in-memory workload sizes desired. The results will be written to a text file called 'testoutput.txt' but you can modify that in runtests.sh as well.

## Test Results

The https://www.tidalscale.com/R_benchmark.html white paper documents our benchmark results from running this test on a 5 node TidalScale system.

## Comments and Observations

* In our experience of trying various CPU configurations, it appears that R does best on systems with 8 CPUs. This is true on both bare metal hardware _and_ TidalScale systems.
* Garbage collection in R affects load times negatively (no matter what system it is running on). In this benchmark we control garbage collection by turning it off (`gc(F)`) during file load and then turning it on (`gc(T)`) for subsequent operations.
* A log-log chart is the best way to observe results in a manner that allows one to see patterns at all sizes of test runs.
